The witness proceeds to drive many more miles toward the town of Cordova, when the witness becomes aware of two large, disc-shaped objects sitting in a meadow beside the roadway.  The witness calls the next morning, and is quite emotionally upset by the experience.  Reports that the event was quite dramatic.

19950722	19950723	 Santa Clara, CA		30 min.	Mr. Peter Davenport National UFO Reporting CenterPO Box 45623, University StationSeattle, WA 98145Dear Peter,Along with my report, I have enclosed a hand-written report from Ben Kwong who witnessed the same UFO&apos;s with me on Saturday, July 22, 1995.  Mr. Kwong is an engineer and lives in San Jose.  I did not get a written report from his 12-year-old son, Michael, but will send it to you if he writes one.  I believe that the reports from Mr. Kwong and myself should be thorough enough.  The only difficulty in writing our reports would be regarding the order in which we saw everything happen.  This is due to the fact that we saw up to five UFO&apos;s (four to five in the air at once).  We were not always looking at the same UFO at the same time.  Since there were several UFO&apos;s in the sky at once during our sighting, we didn&apos;t always focus on the same UFO&apos;s.  Anyway, the following is my accounting of what we saw.  Also, please note that I may have incorrectly given you the time of the sighting as being between 10:30 AM and 11:00 to 11:15.  The time was between 9:30 AM to 10:00 or later.  It was definitely for at least a half hour, maybe an hour (I began teaching my tennis lesson at 9:00 and noticed the first UFO at about 9:30.  When I arrived at home, 2 min. away, it was about 11:00 but I don&apos;t recall watching the UFO&apos;s for more than 45 min. to an hour at the very most -very minimum was a half hour).To whom it may concern:On Saturday, July 22, 1995 at 9:30 AM I, along with Michael Kwong (age 12), and his father (Ben Kwong), had a UFO&apos;s sighting which lasted for at least a half hour (to 10:15 AM or later) over the sky of Santa Clara, CA, from the Marina Playa Apt. complex tennis courts located at 3500 Granada Ave. and Lawrence Expressway (El Camino is a close cross street of Lawrence Expressway).  The sighting first began at 9:30 AM when I was teaching Michael Kwong a tennis lesson.  Michael was practicing his serve and was tossing the ball in the air.  I looked at the ball toss as it went up and noticed that the moon was out.  I also noticed an object by the moon which I took to be a star and appeared stationary like a star.  I looked at the object again and thought it might be moving slowly.  The object appeared to be moving slowly at a very high altitude, perhaps just within the atmosphere or at least at a very high altitude.  I spoke to Michael and began to say things out loud like, &quot;What is that?  What the heck is that?  It&apos;s not an airplane.&quot;  Michael looked up at it as well.  I stopped the lesson out of curiosity to watch this object.  I walked over to the fence and yelled to Ben Kwong, who was sitting in his car reading the newspaper.  I asked him to come out of his car to get a look a the object so we could figure out what it was.  He stood down below the tennis courts, looking up at the object as I and Michael were too.  Then Mr. Kwong came up to the court and all three of us continued to watch the object.  The object looked completely round and whitish in appearance (perhaps due to the altitude or even entering the atmosphere?).  The object slowly moved away from the moon and then curved a slowly headed back toward its original position, and then it appeared to hover and then start to move slowly again.  We watched this object for a few minutes and then we saw another object which looked had the same appearance as the first object.  I don&apos;t remember if Mr. Kwong or I spotted the next object first (Mr. Kwong&apos;s son is near sighted, so he had a harder time seeing).  I believe we watched until finally we saw at least four of the whitish objects in the sky.  At one point it appeared like they were hovering and moving slowly in four corners of the sky.  When they were closer to us, they appeared metallic, sort of a metallic, silver to silver-blue in color.  When they were higher up they initially appeared to be more whitish in color.  Anyway, we continued watching several of these objects as they moved slowly, stop, and move in bizarre paths, unlike airplanes.  They were very high but left no exhaust trail.  They moved and changed direction, unlike weather balloons or satellites.  At some point, after watching the (I&apos;ll call them silver, or metallic-silver/blue) objects, Ben and I noticed a red UFO, completely round like the others, but a metallic-red in color.  We then both observed a silver UFO and the red UFO in a staggered formation, with the silver UFO leading in front to the left of the red UFO (doing what appeared to be the same speed).  We noticed another red object at a lower altitude slowly moving up into the sky (not metallic, but more of an all orange to orange-red in color).  I didn&apos;t, nor did Ben, take much notice of this object as it slowly went up into the sky.  It could have been a balloon and didn&apos;t have the metallic look of the other objects which were very high in the sky.  At some point, the silver UFO&apos;s would just disappear from sight.  I don&apos;t know where they went, maybe out into the upper atmosphere,  Then sometimes one would come back into view.  The red UFO really caught my attention next.  Ben had lost sight of it (you really had to &quot;track&quot; with your eyes without looking away from the UFO&apos;s or it would take a few seconds to find some of them again).  Anyway, I told Ben that I could see the red UFO again.  I saw it moving very slowly up in the sky and then it suddenly shot through the sky at an amazing speed.  I said, &quot; There it goes! There it goes! Look at it go!&quot;  Ben kept saying that he couldn&apos;t find it.  We watched some of the other UFO&apos;s until it seemed that there were no more to see (they had all gone, but we didn&apos;t see them leave).  We had about given up on seeing any more UFO&apos;s up there when I caught sight of the first or perhaps another red UFO.  I told Ben to look up as I pointed to its location.  Ben said he could see it.  Suddenly the red UFO shot across the sky at an amazing speed, much much faster than any jet or rocket could fly (we were watching regular passenger jets crawl across the sky every once in awhile as we watched the UFO&apos;s.  The passenger jets, and some jets which may have been military from Moffet Field, were at a much lower altitude than the UFO&apos;s, a testimony to the speed of the UFO&apos;s).  I kept pointing at the red UFO as it sped across the sky.  We were both in awe, and were both speaking out loud in our amazement of the speed of the object (&quot;There is no way that can be a jet.  Nothing is that fast.  Look at it go.&quot; -etc., etc.).  As I was moving my finger across the sky, tracking the object (in what would take a jet several minutes to travel, I followed the object across the sky in less than ten seconds.  It was still at a very high altitude as well), Ben said he could see a silver UFO right next to the red one.  I said I only could see the red one, but just before the red UFO completely went out of sight, I could see another UFO, a silver one, very close to the red UFO or joined to it.  We were then completely convinced that we saw UFO&apos;s, things which are not man-made.  We didn&apos;t see any more UFO&apos;s for a few minutes, so I resumed my tennis lesson, although I had a very hard time teaching.  We stopped a few minutes later.  I looked up again and saw one lone silver UFO (up so high that it appeared white).  It was hovering and then started to move slowly again.  I told Ben and Michael that there was another one up there.  At this point, we already saw the most exciting part of our sighting (the red UFO &amp; silver UFO shooting off).  Our necks were tired from the strain of looking up, almost straight up at times for over a half hour (possibly an hour or more, as Ben stated, although I can&apos;t be sure).  We really didn&apos;t take much notice of this UFO and we didn&apos;t see it disappear from sight, but it did a couple of minutes later.  We parted between 10:30 and 11:00 AM.  I went back to my apartment and called some TV stations to see if anyone had reported anything (I really thought SOMEONE would have witnessed what we saw and would report it.  The TV station personnel said nobody else called in, plus they seemed rather skeptical of my story.  That annoyed me a bit.  I then called the Air Force in Santa Clara County.  They switched me from command post to command post.  I gave my story up to three times perhaps.  They asked me at what time I saw the UFO&apos;s, took my story, and then said they would transfer me to another command post and to just tell them the same thing (that I told the first people I contacted).  Finally, the Air Force gave me the phone # of the National UFO Reporting Agency (for whom I am writing this report).  I, after giving my story to Peter Davenport, was made aware of the fact that another person in California reported seeing up to five UFO&apos;s on the same day I had my sighting.  This was my first time every seeing anything like this in my life (I&apos;m 29-years-old, teach tennis and am also a computer specialist teaching elementary school.  Ben, like I said, is an engineer.  So I believe we are both credible people).End of ReportI&apos;m waiting to get my grandmother&apos;s written report of her two sightings and my mother&apos;s report of a sighting (these all happened many years ago).  I was afraid to mention their sightings because I thought it might make my sighting less credible.  I indeed immediately felt I had something to share with them and also wanted them to retell of their sightings as well.  My grandmother&apos;s sightings are of particular interest to me since she saw a UFO in the Almaden area of San Jose, CA some 58 years ago.  I teach in this area and my ancestors first settled there in the 1860&apos;s.  Someone emailed me who lives in Almaden to tell me she and her daughter &amp; 14-year-old son had sightings in Almaden.  She said that her son saw one hovering over the school that I teach at.  This was before she even knew that I teach at this school!  Anyway, I don&apos;t know how many people you can believe on the Internet re. sightings, but I know what I saw, and that&apos;s good enough for me.  The only other strange thing I observed in my life was described to me by someone on the Internet as being &quot;ball lightening&quot; or something like it.  I was twelve-years-old at the time.  I don&apos;t know if that is UFO related or not.  Is it just a normal phenomenon.  It happened indoors.  It went under a cot.  The cot shot straight up in the air, about five feet, and there was nothing underneath the cot!  The object was indefinable in shape, just grayish/white, and swirling.  It seemed to react to me as I entered the room and skimmed across the floor.  Any ideas?Sincerely,William D. Baileywbailey@cello.gina.calstate.edu

Sheriff had received many credible reports about red and blue &quot;roman candle&quot; like objects shooting down out of the sky to the ground.  Then witnesses observed a large red cluster in sky, then two bright clusters.  The latter appeared to explode, and then fall to earth.  One red object appeared to be the largest; green ones were smaller.  They were reported to appear to be descending to the earth slowly, at which point a huge white flash of light occurred. Subsequent reports by investigators suggest that some kind(s) of officials were in the area shortly after event, requesting that local and state officials say nothing.((NUFORC Note:  To the best of our knowledge, this event was not only dramatic, but quite bizarre, as well.  We were first contacted Saturday night, January 7, 1995, by an Operations Officer in TEMA, who reported to us that the event had occurred, and that their offices had been activated, as a result of the strange event, and subsequent explosion.  The latter was so dramatic that a member of the local aviation community, who had witnessed the event, immediately following the explosion, drove to the airport and took off in an aircraft to search for what he was certain had been an airliner that had exploded in midair.  TEMA contacted the U. S. Air Force, apparently informing them that a possible UFO event had occurred, and inquiring what TEMA should do.  According to the TEMA official we spoke with, TEMA was informed by the USAF to contact the National UFO Reporting Center.  TEMA did contact our Center by telephone, and faxed to our offices a seven-page document, written by a Warren County Deputy Sheriff, in which that officer describeded the explosion, according to eyewitnesses. We express our sincere gratitude to TEMA for their effort in sharing the information with our Center. Peter Davenport, Director))

(eastern), she was riding the Staten Island Ferry from the tip of Manhattan to Staten Island.  Just as the ferry was passing Governor&apos;s Island, she became aware of a commotion on the east side of the ferry boat.  People were rushing to that side of the ferry, shouting, pointing, and generally raising a ruckus.  She decided to try to determine was the cause of the disturbance, and walked outside onto the passenger deck.  What she saw shocked her.  The object was huge, and it obscured the passengers&apos; view of Governor&apos;s Island.  Many of them reported that the object looked like a city, with lights and a skyline.  However, its presence apparently roiled the water beneath it, causing a froth to appear on the water&apos;s surface!! For days afterward, the witnessed handed out leaflets at the ferry terminal, hoping to contact other passengers who had seen the object.  Those same people approached 9-1-1 facilities, requesting copies of the tape recorded reports of the object, which was also seen from Governor&apos;s Island, but the tapes were either missing, or not made available, they were told. A video tape about the incident was prepared, a copy of which is in the possession of NUFORC. This incident apparently was VERY dramatic, and it was witnessed by dozens, or perhaps hundreds, of people.  We would be most grateful if anyone else who was present that night would please submit a report about what they saw that night.

I&apos;m not sure what you want but I&apos;ll give you a few details:My fiance&apos; and I were driving down Route 3 East in Virginia, I think we had passed Route 301, and were heading towards Colonial Beach.  This was Sunday, August 20 1995, at 1345 EST.  We both saw a bright reflection in the sky, the sun was reflecting off of it and we thought it was an airplane.  I guess it turned a little because the brightness stopped.  We both watched for a few seconds, and noticed it didn&apos;t have any wings or tail like an airplane would have.  It was cigar shaped, (it looked like a 747 w/o wings or a tail).  All of a sudden it was gone!  I looked down at the road for a second (I was driving), looked back up and couldn&apos;t find it.  My fiance&apos; said it just disappeared!Please let me know if any other sightings were reported on the East Coast this weekend.  Was I seeing things?  I&apos;ve always believed in UFO&apos;s but I never thought I&apos;d see one!                                   ((name and address deleted))

19951108	19951108	 Pilot Rock, OR	 light	1 hr.	Two brothers were returning to Pendleton, OR, and Dixie, WA, after hunting in Oregon.  Upon approaching Pilot Rock, OR, the brother driving the lead vehicle, a Suzuki (Samurai?) noticed a peculiar cluster of blue-white colored round lights, positioned in a square or rectangular pattern, ahead.  He called his brother on CB radio (Ch. 4) to ask is he saw it, and the brother answered that he certainly did.  The lights disappeared from sight, then reappeared on the other side of the road.  They passed through Pilot Rock, and the object became visible again as they were leaving that town.  The object had the same appearance as it had had before they arrived at Pilot Rock, and it stayed with them (according to their conscious recollection, for another 30 minutes. The brothers made several interesting observations at the time of the incident.  Most interesting was the fact that even though they were talking over a CB channel that traditionally is used very heavily by loggers, and other users in that area of Oregon (Ch. 4), they heard no other users during the entire experience!  Also, they saw no other traffic on their side of the highway,. even though they remember seeing oncoming traffic in the other lane.  When they got home, they topped off the fuel tanks in their trucks.  Craig&apos;s vehicle indicated that he had driven 98.7 miles from deer camp, where both he and his brother had filled their vehicles&apos; fuel tanks from fuel cans.  When they got to Pendleton, his vehicle, which was getting about 25 miles per gallon, took less than 2 gallons of fuel!Craig had spent 9 years in the military, during which time, he said, he had seen many different types of weapons used.  This aerial event, or object, was like nothing he had ever seen before, he said.

When the UFO was over the road (still way to high to see detail) the tail&quot;fired&quot; twice, like some kind ofafte rburners.And was rocketed out of sight to the east ina matter of seconds, way faster than anything either of us had ever seen.

19961120	19961204	 North Port, FL		8 min.	A man was outside his home for a last smoke and to walk his dog, before going to bed. He looked at the night sky to the southwest, because that is the direction where there is no treeline, and he suddenly noticed a light, which at first he thought might be a star, although it appeared to him to be rather large to be a star. When he looked back at a a couple of minutes later, it was now larger than a full moon!  Also, it appeared to be getting closer to him, and was lower to the horizon, he thought.  Then he realized that it had become two distinct lights, both bright white.  At this point, he summoned his wife, who also saw the object as it passed directly overhead.  they both agreed it was less that 500 feet above them. It was not a helicopter, and it was too slow for an aircraft.  The two lights were on the bottom, and they were glowing.  They could see an outline of the object as it passed overhead, and it appeared to be &quot;pie-shaped.&quot; They both heard a really low hum as the object passed overhead very slowly.  The object suddenly disappeared approximately 2 seconds after it had passed overhead.  The caller added that he and his wife have three cats, one of which is an &quot;outside&quot; cat, and two that are &quot;indoor&quot; cats.  After the incident, all of the them were gone, and they did not return until approximately one week later. Their dog, which normally is very eager to go outside, would not go outside for several days without coaxing from his owner.  The dog, a pit bull (?) was apparently very upset for several days afterward.  At 2315 hrs. that night, after the sighting, the dog started barking and snapping at the front door, and he would not go through that door for 4-5 days.

19970404	19970404	 Winsted, CT		5 sec.	The caller went outside to walk his dog and look at the comet. He looked to the east, and he noticed movement in the night sky.  Upon looking closely at the object, he noticed that it was 7-9 lights (est.), oriented in a &quot;boomerang&quot; shape.  The lights were orange in color, and they were very faint, fainter than typical stars, for example. The object moved very fast from the eastern sky to the northwest sky, traversing approximately 120-130 degrees (est.) of arc in approximately 5 seconds.  No sound was apparent.The caller does not have internet access.

19960920	19970206	 Cancun (Melia Turquesa Hotel) (Mexico),	 light	4-5 seconds	SUMMARY:  3 dull orange lights closely clustered traveling from NNW to SSE. Traveling at high altitude &amp; rate of speed with a abrupt jog to the east directly above then continuing SSE.After some showers, clear evening sky to the North, high broken skies to the South East.Sitting on sixth floor veranda, nearest to the beach, lights in courtyard had been turned off.Wife and I were sky browsing when my peripheral vision picked up some rapid movement to the NorthEast. The object, which looked like 3 dull orange lights close together, moved very rapidily from10:00 to 2:00 with a slight jog to the East at 12:00. Its speed was faster than an aircraft, and had no other lights. We lost sight of this object over the clouds to the South East.The skies were crystal clear with the exception of the high clouds to the South East.I am a Director of Electronics and have been in the industry for 30+ years. Served a brief stint in the Navy flying in P5M&apos;s in the mid 60&apos;s in Vietnam.My wife is a business office manager in the hospital field for the past 25+ years.

19961115	19961123	 Blossburg, PA		30 sec.	The caller, a senior member of the military (ret./artillery), together with another observer, had witnessed a very peculiar sight in the night sky to the north of his location. The observer was located approximately 20 miles south of the NY/PA state line10 miles south of Mansfield, and 6 miles south of the intersection of U.S. Routes #15 and #6. He saw what appeared to be a commercial airliner, with normal navigation lights, flying from the northern sky to the southeast with a round, bright orange ball of light about &quot;200 mils&quot; (approx 7 degrees arc) in front of the aircraft!  The object was approximately &quot;10 mils&quot; (approx. 20 arc minutes) in diameter.The type of aircraft he witnessed was unknown to him, but he felt certain it was a commercial type a/c.  It had &quot;blue and red lights&quot; (sic) on it. He commented that the crew of the aircraft MUST have seen the object, which he thought was probably directly ahead of the aircraft.  The object was NOT a meteor, the observer reported.  It was moving across the sky in a methodical fashion, at a seemingly steady pace.  It was certainly not streaking.   Neither object made any noise, which struck the observer as being very strange. He did not hear any jet noise whatever, even though the object passed directly overhead of his position.
19960322	19960323	 Houston, TX		10 sec.	Caller first called at 2153 hrs. on Friday, 22MR96, and left a message. He was standing outside to look for the comet, when he noticed a V-shaped formation of points of light almost directly overhead.  Eadh &quot;wing&quot; of the &quot;V&quot; consisted of approximately 10 objects, each about the size of a small star.  Each side of the &quot;V&quot; was swept about 10 degrees behind the straight line oriented perpendicular to the line of flight of the formation. The formation had a very high angular velocity, and the observers estimate was that they were moving at a very high speed.  He stated that they looked like a formation of jet fighters, but there was no sound.  The formation was moving faster than a formation of fighters would have been moving.  The observer watched them pass through approximately 15 degrees of arc, moving from west to east--toward the lights of Houston to the east of his position--when they disappeared from his sight because of the brightness of the ambient light.

19970107	19970108	 Amelia, OH	 light	5 min.	SUMMARY:  We saw a large &quot;spotlight&quot; at about 100-150 ft directly above us. It had one flashing red light above the spotlight and two white lights to each side of the object (4 total). Then another light appeared out of nowhere behind the first one. This one looked to be the same as the other. We quickly sped away in the car to his house about 500 meters away. When we got out of the car the first one was still directly above us as if it backed up to follow us. The object made no sound at all, even though it was so low to the ground.It was dark out. It was in a residential area so there were houses and trees around. The object was rather large (bigger than any plane around here) We saw two of them, one was REALLY close the other was about 100 meters behind the other. Both of them were hovering. They were both dark in color, either black or gray. The &quot;spotlights&quot; were very bright.
19951213	19951214	 Upper Makefield, PA		30 sec.	Two young girls were driving near their neighborhood, when they noticed extremely bright lights above their car.  The lights were bright white, and appeared to be &quot;turning.&quot;  Suddenly, they turned blue, and just disappeared.  The father of one of the two girls called the hotline.  He reported the incident, and added that he had called his neighbor to ask whether he had seen the lights.  The neighbor said that he had not, but that his dogs had been actually skrieking in a most unusual fashion, until the power at their house suddenly failed, at which time the dogs walked into the house as if nothing had occured.  The father reported that there had been a sighting in his area 17 years earlier.

19961107	19961207	 Seattle, WA	 sphere	7 sec.	SUMMARY:  Dimly lit group of colored objects hovering over the Woodland Park Zoo emitting light beams similar to spotlights.I was walking my dogs with a friend in the park adjacent to the zoo; it was a lull in the heavy rain.  We walked into a parking lot to use the tunnel on the way home.   As we emerged from the trees my friend pointed upwards.  Just above the zoo, 400 yards from the parking lot were the four shapes in the sky:  two faint blue spheres moving back and forth like in vibration as a pair.  Closer to us was a cylindrical object the same width of the spheres, and length three times the diameter (1x3), emitting a rose colored tint.  The closest object was a larger sphere emitting a deep maroon glow.  The three (four) objects hovered back and forth independently, while their lights seemed to engulf them and be focused towards the ground at the same time.  After a few second of looking at these objects and being in awe the purple sphere became bright to the point neither of us could look any longer and were forced to look down.  When I looked up again there was nothing.  My friend then saw nothing. My dogs did not seem to notice anything.

He saw a pale yellow light to the southeast of tower.  It looked somewhat square, although he could not be sure that he had had a good look at it.  The object passed directly overhead of his position, at which time he noted that it was dropping something off of it.  He thought the object might have been something conventional, like a flare suspended from a balloon.  He called the Walla Walla Police Department and reported it, I believe he reported.

19961025	19961101	 Laurel, MD		25 sec.	Caller was entering Highway I-95 (southbound) in Laurel, Maryland, when he noticed two round objects sitting still in the sky.  At first, he thought they were the type of colored spheres mounted on telephone lines to make the lines visible to pilots.  His impression was that the objects were perhaps 1 or 2 miles from him, and perhaps 1/4 mile above ground level, and maybe 200 yards from one another. (He saw a commercial jet in the distance, apparently leaving Baltimore airport or Andrews AFB, so he had something to compare with the objects he was observing.)The color of the objects was that of pencil lead, perhaps with a bit of copper-colored tinge to them.  They were generally round, but they were slightly out of round at the equator.The object just moved  out of sight rapidly, in approximately one second!  They just STREAKED.Caller called Laurel, MD, police, but they said it was a matter for Arundel Co. sheriff&apos;s office.  Sheriff&apos;s office said it was a matter for the state police.  Then he called Andrews AFB, and they said they had nothing

Suddenly, a second identical object raced up to the first, and both objects proceeded to move in a westerly direction.  At first, the observer thought the objects might be seagulls, since they have them on Moses Lake.  But the flight of the objects was unlike that of birds--there were no wings on it, nothing was flapping, and the flight was very smooth. His father had seen something very similar about a week earlier, he thought on 06JN96. The two objects parted, rose in altitude, veered together, then disappeared.

The object had rows of very bright lights (on the side?), and it had &quot;rainbow light&quot; in the center. the caller got a very good look at the back end of the craft.  It seemed to have a very small &quot;afterburner&quot; on the trailing edge, which was round.
19970206	19970212	 Coober Pedy, S.A. (Approx. 250km south of) (Australia),	 light		SUMMARY:  A stormy night on the Stuart Highway. Sighting of a UFO which appeared to land,  a UFO chasing the car some 50m behind, and the sighting of a man which was extremely unusual looking.The first event to happen was the sighting of a &apos;roadwork&apos; man sweeping the highway.  Whilst driving along the highway, an extremely bright light suddenly appeared in front of us. At first we thought it was a truck coming towards us - common on the highway-but as we drove towards it we realised it was a stationary truck with a bright light attatched to the front of the grill. Upon getting closer to the light, it was that bright and blinding that we had to slow down to 10kms just to see the road and where we were going. Half the road was closed and suddenly we were able to see a man. There he was sweeping the road at 21:30(approx) 200kms from the nearest roadhouse. We slowly drove up to him to explain that we could not see the road due to the light and essentialy could not see him. We now believe that not being able to see him was what he wanted. The man hardly showed his face and what we did see - he had an extremely high forehead and very wide set eyes. He was approx. 7 fee!t tall and of stocky build. He did not want us talking to him and made every attempt to get us to move on quickly. As we drove off the light slowly disappeared - which is what got us thinking. Due to the cloud cover that night, a light of that intensity would have cast quite a bit of glare i.e. we would have seen the light from quite a distance, however the light suddenly flashed on and we were not descending or ascending a hill! My questions at the time were who was he, what was he doing that far out of town at that time of night and what was he sweeping off the road?Eventually that passed as we drove along the highway again.Approximately 30mins after this happened an extremely bright light came up from behind us - we had not passed a car since the roadwork man - to within 50m of us. It followed  our car for about 4 seconds before disappearing. The lights intensity was similar to that of a cars high-beam headlights and was orange-yellow in colour. Neither of us said anything - we were starting to get spooked.As we were driving up the road we were heading into a storm. As we got closer to the storm I was checking the stars to see where the storm cloud started - it was that black that there was a definite black line where the storm cloud startes. As I was watching the stars I noticed an extremely orange star. As I continued watching it moved forward so it kept up with the car, not falling behind like the other stars were. From where we were this &apos;star&apos; was about 5-6mm across. As I continued watching the light moved on a diagonal path towards the horizon and was now in front of the car. This light continued downwards until it reached a point slightly above the horizon, if not on the horizon, and that is where it stayed until the blackness of the strom blocked my view.Among these happenings we passed a military style vehicle with no insignia which was cruising up the highway rather slowly. We could not see the driver as we passed the vehicle.The storm that we drove through was extremely active for about 2 hours until we actually reached it. (there had been continuous lightning for these two hours). Yet as soon as the light was blocked out by the clouds all lightning stopped. As far as we know a storm does not just stop suddenly.As we neared Coober Pedy, a white 4WD suddenly pulled out from the side of the road and forced our car to slow down considerably. In the back window of this car two shapes could be seen moving and I can tell you with all honesty that they did not look like dogs or humans or any other animal but I did not get a very good look at them so I cannot accurately say or judge what they were.We eventually made it to Coober Pedy and were relieved to see other humans.The whole event really spooked both me and my fiance and we have vowed never to travel on the highway agein at night. (the highway runs directly from Adelaide to Alice Springs and continues to Darwin, passing through townships and roadhouses.It passes through some of the most lonely land in Australia).As we checked out of our motel the next morning we metioned these events to the receptionist who just smiled and said oh well you wouldn&apos;t be the first to talk about things like that. That was all we could get out of her,she wouldn&apos;t talk anymore.For my fiance, it is the second time that he has witnessed events of a &apos;supernatural&apos; kind - he is in his late twenties. I have witnessed other happenings including metallic cigar shaped objects and other orange lights resembling stars but moving otherwise to indicate that they were not a star. I am 18.I am not providing my address as yet for security reasons - as well as I only connected to the net yesterday and haven&apos;t bothered yet to set up an e-mail address on my computer. I will watch this site for further information.I have provided this report because I know how hard it is to gain information on these matters. As well as in the interests of &apos;science&apos;.I hope you make some use of this report.

It appeared to him to be a blend of red, blue, and bright white in color.  It left no trail in the sky the way he would expect a meteor or a burning aircraft to do.  The caller was looking to the northwest when he observed the object, and he estimated its angle of elevation above the horizontal plane at &quot;38 degrees.&quot;  He added that he is &quot;a pilot,&quot; and that he estimated its speed at not less than Mach 3.  He called again at 2230 hours to report that he had seem the same thing at 2230 hours!  It had gone directly over his head, and it was traveling to the northwest at a very high rate of speed.  He estimated its size as bigger than a nickel held at arm&apos;s length.He volunteered that &quot;something is awry?&quot;

Suddenly, the wife, who was in the passenger&apos;s seat, observed a large, bright, white light in the left portion of the windshield.  It was much brighter than a helicopter light, and had a steady glow to it.  At first, she said nothing to her husband, but when it disappeared from her sight behind some cypress trees, and then was visible again after their car had passed them, she realized the object was probably not an aircraft, and it was not a reflection off a side window. Suddenly, the object developed a green or blue tail, and it accelerated very rapidly, disappearing from their sight.   The object was moving generally from the southwest to the northwest.
19961124	19961124	 Bismarck, ND		60 sec.	The caller noticed a small, circular, orange object, apparently hovering in the night sky to the south of the National Weather Service offices. The color of the object reminded the observer of the color of the orange flame at the bottom of the space shuttle when it is launched. The object was 65-70 degrees off the horizon, and it was larger than any of the stars in the sky, although smaller than the moon. He said that if a person were looking at the sky, he could not fail to miss it.

19961229	19961229	 Bastrop, LA	 light	1 hour	SUMMARY:  due south of bastropA bright light was seen in the sky, and was thought to be a star until it started moving.  It moved back and forth, and up and down.  Sometimes it climbed in a diagonal course. The object also changed colors.  It went from blue to redto green. Later, WE briefly saw the same object again, but in a different part of sky.  I often look for such objects, but I&apos;ve never seen anything quiet like this.
19871220	19970119	 Las Vegas (60-70 miles north-east of, Interstate 15 North), NV	 light	3 - 4 minutes	SUMMARY:  Viewed pairs of red strobing lights extended across wide area of Nevada desert and watched as two F-15 fighter aircraft tried to intercept light formation.On December 20, 1989 I and two co-workers were on our way to Aspen,CO. We were driving a 24Ft. rental truck loaded with items for our employer&apos;s winter home.We were approximately 60-70 miles north-east of Las Vegas when we heard cargo in the rear of the truck shift. I pulled over to check the cargo and found everything secure. We all took this opportunity to stretch our legs and while facing away from the highway and looking in a southerly direction,I noticed six pairs of strobing red lights. They were located on a east-west plane and seemed to be evenly spaced. A large mountain stood in the distance andI later learned that it was Virgin Peak. What caught my attention readily was the very slow strob speed of the lights. I looked for other color patterns and none were visable. It is almost impossible for me to determine distance or height of objects, and no shape patterns were visable due to impending sunset.There was no noticable noise at the onset of sighting. After viewing objects for approximtely 2-3 minutes we noticed the sound of jet aircraft. Suddenly from a north-west direction two F-15 fighters flew over at a tremendous rate of speed. I would estimate that they were flying at approximately 500 feet and as they passed the ground reverberated with the sonic boom. We all watched in awe as the pairs of red strobbing lights moved tremendously fast to the east and suddenly in unison changed course to the south-east and raised altitude until they vanished. This all took place within a matter of seconds, and the pursuing fighters had no chance what so ever to catch these objects. This was truly a hair-raising experience for all of us and we did not waste any time in exiting the area.

19960131	19970121	 Buckhead Ridge, FL	 light	5 min 30 sec	SUMMARY:  I observed an object apparently making a controlled reentry or entry into the atmosphere.  It was the size of a medium sized star and  fairly far away.The object caught my attention by leaving a bright yellow and orange trail down toward earth at about an attitude of 40 degrees above the horizon which lasted for about 20-30 seconds before it disappeared from the highest point of origin to the lowest.  It was round and tiny like a medium magnitude star and appeared at the time of the orange trail&apos;s disappearance and proceeded to move about directly East and perfectly parallel to the horizon, not appearing to lose any altitude at all.  I noted the time at the initial observation and it travelled eastward for 5 minutes before it disappeared over some high cirrus or haze.It appeared to be NNW of me,  perhaps over Orlando around a hundred miles away.I checked and there were no shuttles up that night.  I am a private pilot, a scientist and a weather spotter, with a degrees in Psychology and Education as well as having been recognized by Who&apos;s Who for outstanding career achievement.  I was advised to record this for posterity.

A pilot and his 1st officer in a Beechcraft 1900 with passengers, while flying at 16,000 feet between layers of solid overcast 90 miles southeast of Saginaw, MI, suddenly see a large, bizarre ball of light appear in front of them.  They both thought it was another aircraft and were concerned that it might collide with them, so they turned on their identification lights and initiated a turn.  The object apparently was capable of &quot;jumping&quot; suddenly, perhaps as much as 20 or 30 miles within 1 second time.  The crew requested clearance to descend, which they did.  they descended to 9500 feet, but the object appeared to descend with them, staying on their now, &quot;12:00&quot; position.  They continued their descent to 3,500 feet, where they entered the clouds. Another airliner, a Northwest commuter (Callsign: &quot;Masaba&quot;) witnessed the interaction.  Multiple conversations occured with Cleveland Center and Saginaw Approach about the incident. The crew borrowed a still camera from one of the passengers, and attempted to photograph the object.  The camera and film were returned to the passenger after the photograph had been taken. Copy of radio communication requested 04MR96 under FOIA.

They were moving relative to one another.  They exhibited no landing or marker lights. Then, one at a time, they began to ascend, and they went through the overcast, or clouds (?).  Other individuals called his radio station and stated that they, too, had seen the objects.

It was dark out but the lights from the school lit up the playground.  Corn fields were on 3 sides of the school and a street to the other.  We were sitting and talk when suddenly the silence behind us stoped.  We herd a soft humming like the sound the comes from one of those green power boxes (the big ones with the large hinges)   Then a large triangular shaped object came from behind us (to the south).  It was about 100 ft.off the ground.  It had yellow flashing lights on each point.  It stayed above us for about 2-3 mins then rapidly accelarated back to the south over a mountain. After it burst away a very bright light shone for about a half a second.

The caller saw a circular ship, principally the bottom part of the object, and it had no &quot;belly lights.&quot;  It was not an aircraft.  He was emphatic on this point.  It was apparently moving very slowly, since he reported that it approached his location for up to 5 minutes, or so, he thought.  He saw the craft again on Tuesday, 29JA96.

19970101	19970101	 Clatonia, NE		10 min.	Woman called to report that she had been driving west on an east-west runninbg highway with her daughter (age 9 yrs.), when they both noticed an &quot;aircraft&quot; with 3x blinking lights on it, located about 1 mile east of the town of Clatonia.  The light on the &quot;south part&quot; of the craft was blue, the light on the bottom was very bright red, and the light on the north side was white. The caller stopped her car before she passed underneath it, rolled her window down, and looked up at it.  She heard nothing, no sound whatever. She then drove on to the next intersection, turned her car around, hoping to see whether the object had left. It was then that she and her daughter witnessed a second object near the first, then a third and a fourth on the opposite side of the highway from the first, and very low to the ground.  Even though there was low ground fog, they could see the objects distinctly.  They saw a fifth object shortly afterward, at which point they decided to drive into town.  As they drove toward Clatonia, they saw another object come out of the fog. She called Columbus, NE, airport, where she learned that they had had no aircraft in the area at that time.  They also told her that they had a radar &quot;shadow&quot; in the area where her sighting had taken place

19930209	19970116	 Lufkin, TX	 delta	5-7 min.	SUMMARY:  Family traveling home along a rural farm road spotted unusual lights/object in the sky moving slowly from east to west and pulled over to investigate.As we were traveling home along a rural farm road we spotted an unusual light in the sky moving slowly toward the road from east to west.  It didn&apos;t move like any familiar airplane, so we pulled over to watch for a minute.  The object was shaped similar to a Stealth, except with a thinner, smoother head-on profile, and with much more bluntly squared-off wingtips and nose.  It moved extremely slowly, no faster than a motorized hangglider,  and completely without engine noise, although it was at a relatively low altitude. (below low-hanging clouds.)  As it passed over our vehicle, its span covered the length of the Suburban.  It had a very large white spotlight at its nose and two bright lights at each wingtip.  The underside had many patterned rows of small colored lights, with an amber double row down the center.  The underside gave the impression of being textured or plated.  There was absolutely no engine noise, even though the craft was very low and very slow.  After pass!ing overhead, two or three small, blue &quot;sparkles&quot; dropped from the craft.  Not quite believing what we had witnessed, and not being fervent UFO watchers, we decided not to report the sighting. Witnesses were myself, a high school library director, my husband, an industrial chemist, and my 15-yr-old son.
19960603	19960611	 Oglethorpe, GA		30 min.	MUFON State Director relays report: A group of 13 adult witnesses observe a large craft, decribed as a &quot;large box in the air.&quot;  The object looked like two terrapin shells attached at their edges, and tapering in the back.  The upper shell was dark, flat, slate gray; the other was beige.  The object was estimated to be approximately 50&apos; long and 30&apos; wide.  It was estimated to be 20x the diameter of the moon, viewed from the observers&apos; vantage point. The object was lit on the interior, and the observers could look into the lighted interior.  It did not hurt the observers&apos; eyes to look at the object.  The object was turning around its vertical axis at approximately 1 revolution per second.  It was fairly low in the sky, perhaps 1,000 feet, estimated by the observers, and it was moving from the northwest to the southwest.
19960322	19960322	 Meridian, MS		20 sec.	Caller was driving east on I-20, and at Mile Marker #120, he observed a silver-colored, metallic-appearing, &quot;opal shaped&quot; object in the sky.  It was 15 degrees to the draver&apos;s right, and 30 degrees above the horizontal, and it was hovering totally motionless.  The object clearly appeared to be rotating, and it occasionally would reflect sunlight, as if it had a flat side on it.  The observer pulled off the highway and stopped.  As he was watching it, the object instantly just disappeared.  The caller was trained in the military in photo analysis, and perhaps other specialties.  He was very precise in his description, using very unambiguous terms, and the proper use of angles, rather than distances. Also, he served in the UN forces in 1979 with the Peace Keeping Mission, arising out of the Camp David Accords.

The caller was riding his motorcycle with his friend, when they realized that the father of the friend, who had been riding behind them, was no longer in sight. The young men turned around, drove back down the road, where they found the father stopped in a turnout.  The father told them to turn off their engines and lights, and that there was something in the valley they should look at. The three of them witnessed six huge lights hovering in the night sky, and a seventh identical object sitting on the ground, which lit up the valley they were in for &quot;10 to 15 miles around.&quot;  The objects in the sky were oriented in a straight row.Suddenly, the object on the ground began to rise into the air, at which time the object positioned on the far right of the formation in the sky moved down and under its neighboring object.The light that had been on the ground disappeared from sight, and then the objects in the sky disappeared in sequence.  When they arrived at their destination, the father informed the others that he had seen another object &quot;on the other side of the mountain.&quot;

19970129	19970130	 East Greenwich, RI	 disk	5  minutes	SUMMARY:  I witnessed a UFO which may be of the Lazar&quot;Sport Model&quot; variety when I was leaving work to drive home.The UFO was circular in shape, with three distinct propulsion units on the bottom,and several red rectangular lights around the perimeter.  I witnessed this UFO when I was leaving work to drive home.  It was travelling in straight lines, forming a triangular pattern, approximate airspeed was about 150 MPH as far as I could tell.  I had the impression that it was of the type described by Bob Lazar, UUP/element 115propulsion. After approximately 5 minutes,the UFO sped away to the north.  I believe that I was in some kind of mental contact with the occupants of the craft at the time,as the triangular course seemed to circle directly around me also. I am currentlyworking on some sketches of the craft, bu tI thought it important to report the event as soon as possible.  I will email the sketches in JPEG format as soon as they are complete.Perhaps they were interested in this location because it is in proximity to several of our National Guard military installations.
19961222	19961222	 Reno, NV	 other	3 seconds	SUMMARY:  I saw a HUGE ball like flash grow and then&apos;erupt&apos; while looking out of my windowfacing SE. It was not lightening. I love towatch the weather. Especially adverse weather.The ball was at least 300ft high if it waswhere I believe it was. It was acompanied byno sound of thunder.Sorry if this sounds like it is not important to me, because it is very important to me.I have been waiting for any kind of sighting.This is my first actual sighting of something and I would apreciate any kind of response.I was sitting with my friend on the computer while on AOL. We were just talking to a friend and watching the snow fall whensuddenly there was a blue light outside. Itwas quite bright from where we were. And itseemed to be coming from some distance away.the start of it was like a huge blue floodlight was on in the SE corner of Reno. Thenit &apos;erupted&apos; into a huge ball of light. Overapproximately 2 seconds it grew into anapproximate 200-300 feet in diameter. At thatpoint it just seemed to explode into thesky. There was no visible body or mass. Andno sound. The thunder around here can be heardquite well due to Reno&apos;s Geological features.It is a valley surrounded by very largemountains. Making the sound travel factorvery high. Regardless, I have never seenany kind of light or fire work or lighteningstrike even remotely close to this.Thank You For Your Time,Brannon G. Blaylock

The caller, his wife, and their 5-year old daughter, witness a bizarre, very large, diamond-shaped object hovering motionless in the sky in a rural area southeast of Gainesville.  They first spotted the object to their left as they drove back to the city on 39th Avenue just before they reached Highway 26.  The object has &quot;massive flood lights&quot; on it, which &quot;pointed down.&quot;  The object passed within &quot;1-2 football fields&quot; of their position, although at one point, the caller reported that it &quot;went across (them).&quot;  The husband could see a peculiar &quot;shadow&quot; around (?) the object. He reported that he had never seen a UFO before, although quickly qualified it to say that he thought he had seen one 10-11 years prior. He added that his daughter, who had witnessed the entire episode, talked about UFO&apos;s and flying saucers all the way back to their home on the northwest side of Gainesville.

The lights may have been advertising lights, but this caller swore that they were not like that.
19930701	19961219	 Lynnwood/Alderwood Manor, WA	 light	several minutes	SUMMARY:  A bright red light hovers in the sky and then disappears.One night in July 1993, while lying in bed, I spotted through my mini-blinds a jewel-toned, red light hovering in the air where normally there would be none. I peeked through my blinds and saw a red light through the trees.  I went to my deck where I could see unobstructed and the red light was about 100 yards high.  It was a light that looked like a ruby with light coming through it.  It moved 2-3 degrees left and then right and then it disappeared.  The observer is a suburban housewife with a background in journalism and advertising.

19951224	19960226	 Christiansburg, VA	 triangle	1-2 min.	Man called to report that he, together with three other observers, had been witness to a an occurrence involving four aircraft, three of which appeared to be conventional-type military aircraft, and the fourth appeared to be an unusual, triangular-shaped object with non-conventional lighting. The observers first noticed two aircraft, which appeared to be flying a parallel course directly south, in tandem formation, at the same altitude, and separated by only 1/2 to 1 mile.  The apparent close proximity of the two aircraft is what first drew the observers&apos; attention and caused them to conclude that they were military aircraft, as opposed to commercial or private aircraft.  The individual who called and who submitted the written report stated that he and the other observers are familiar with the general flight characteristics of aircraft flying out of Roanoke, VA, airport, and they invariably maintain greater separation than what they observed for these two aircraft that had drawn their attention. Suddenly, the observers became aware of a third &quot;aircraft,&quot; which was directly ahead of the first two aircraft.  The observers immediately developed the impression that the third &quot;aircraft&quot; was being pursued by the first two they had witnessed.  The third object was less well illuminated that the first two, and its lighting pattern consisted of three red, somewhat &quot;subdued&quot; lights, arranged in a triangular pattern. Its size was approximately that of the other two aircraft. Approximately 30-60 seconds after the observers had spotted the first two conventional aircraft, they suddenly noticed that a third aircraft was flying from the northwest directly toward the triangular aircraft, apparently on a &quot;collision&quot; course with it, closing from the starboard side of the triangular-shaped aircraft, and flying at a somewhat higher speed that the triangular ship exhibited. Within seconds of sighting the fourth aircraft, the observers realized that none of the conventional aircraft were able to keep up with the triangular craft, all of them beginning to fall behind at the latter apparently began to accelerate.  The third conventional aircraft fell behind the triangle, and began to fly parallel to the other conventional aircraft. The incident was reported to the FAA in Roanoke, VA, and to Andrews AFB.
